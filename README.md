# Pooled-melanin-variance
Analysis of pooled variants WGS data 

This project aims to identify genetic polymorphisms that contribute to variation in melanin pigmentation among strains of Cryptococcus deneoformans.
Two strains, JEC21 and NIH433 were crossed to generate 425 F1 progeny. Melanin production of the progeny strains was quantified and strains exhibiting extreme phenotypes at either end of the spectrum (darkest and lightest respectively) were pooled in groups of 25.
